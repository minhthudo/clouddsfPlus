# Cloud Decision Support Framework Plus version 2.0 (CloudDSF+ v2.0)
The CloudDSF+ v2.0 Approach

This website has been developed as part of the master's thesis "Refinement and Extension of the Cloud Decision Support Framework for Application Migration to the Cloud" written by Balduin Metz at the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

[CloudDSF+ v1.0](https://github.com/bametz/clouddsfPlus) represents a refinement and extension of the previously developed [Cloud Decision Support Framework (CloudDSF)](https://github.com/adarsow/clouddsf). The underlying concept of CloudDSF as well as CloudDSF+ v1.0 has been envisioned and developed by Andrikopoulos et al.

CloudDSF+ v2.0 has been developed as part of the diplomaâ€™s thesis "Introduction of Cloud Provider-specific Knowledge and Further Evaluation of the Cloud Decision Support Framework" written by Do Thi Minh Thu at the [Institute of Architecture of Application Systems](http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/indexE.php) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

CloudDSF+ v2.0 introduces major cloud vendors in the cloud market together with their popular cloud services, therefore represents a further refinement of the CloudDSF+ v1.0.
